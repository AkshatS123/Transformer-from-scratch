## üß† Key Concepts Learned

### Attention Mechanisms
**Status:** üîÑ Learning

**What I understand so far:**
- Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of input
- Query, Key, Value paradigm for information retrieval
- Scaled dot-product attention formula: `Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/‚àöd_k)V`

**Questions to explore:**
- Why do we scale by ‚àöd_k?
- How do multiple heads help?
- What's the intuition behind the QKV mechanism?

### Transformer Architecture
**Status:** üîÑ Learning

**What I understand so far:**
- Encoder processes input sequence
- Decoder generates output sequence
- Both use self-attention and feed-forward networks
- Positional encoding adds sequence position information

**Questions to explore:**
- Why this specific architecture works so well?
- How does the encoder-decoder attention work?
- What's the role of each component?

## üìö Research Notes

### Paper Analysis: "Attention Is All You Need"

**Key Insights:**
1. **Self-attention**: Allows each position to attend to all positions in the sequence
2. **Multi-head attention**: Enables model to attend to information from different representation subspaces
3. **Positional encoding**: Adds position information since attention has no recurrence or convolution

**Mathematical Formulations:**
```
MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O
where head_i = Attention(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
```

**Questions for Implementation:**
- How to implement efficient attention computation?
- What's the best way to handle variable sequence lengths?
- How to optimize memory usage for large sequences?
